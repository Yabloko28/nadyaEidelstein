<p>The series of animations was made during the <a href="http://luminousbodies.com/">Luminous Bodies</a> art residency on Toronto Island. I continued to explore the intersection between mathematics, digital and organic aesthetics, while being inspired by the idea that any process happening in this world is dictated and controlled by mathematical laws. The animations are mostly created with coding (Processing) and some elements were added using After Effects.</p>

<p>The shapes used are mostly vegetative and they are referencing human body and its parts a lot. They form new imaginative creatures, which behaviour is both human- and plant-like. The movements and actions happening have a lot in common with the most natural human body functions as desire, sex, reproduction, food consumption etc. My aim was to represent them in the most fun, humorous way deprived of any body-shaming or gender stereotypes.</p>

<p>The animations lack any particular plot, they are meditative and satisfying to watch and my intention was to make the viewer get lost in them, while watching the most common and natural, but at the same time mesmerizing and wonderful processes of life, happening within any creature on this Earth.</p>
