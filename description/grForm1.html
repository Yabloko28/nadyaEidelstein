<p>The collection is entitled On Growth, Form and Computer and it investigates the intersection of art, science and design. Having been influenced by sculptural shapes found in nature (vegetation, human bogies) and by the scientific ideas that all natural shapes are determined by physical forces acting upon them during the process of growth, I developed this jewellery collection.</p>

<p>All the jewellery pieces have a very organic feel to them but they were all produced digitally.</p>

<p>Researching the way science and technology have been developing in the 21st century, I discovered the digital method of fabrication used in modern architecture.</p>

<p>All jewellery pieces were created in 3d programme, sectioned, each section was laser-cut and shapes were assembled layer by layer and sanded outside manually. This process imitates the work of 3d-printing, a new way of manufacturing process controlled by computers that is often described as 'growing' or additive manufacturing.</p>
