<p>This piece was generated using 3d programme and then digitally fabricated. The intricate shape of seed magnified hundreds of times was recreated in software and sliced evenly. The component parts were laser cut as the precise digital means of generation requires the involvement of digital ways of manufacturing. Then the constitute parts were riveted together by hand.</p>

<p>The object can function as a pendant or as a miniature sculpture. The piece was mainly inspired by biomimicry: paying attention to sculptural traits of nature on its macro and micro levels, the object was created according to the logic of nature, when a piece is 'grown' rather than made.</p>
