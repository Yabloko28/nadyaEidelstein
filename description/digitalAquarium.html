<p>The ongoing project is a series of gifs, or digital collages, that combine graphics created with code and the altered illustrations by Ernst Haeckel from his well-known book 'Art Forms in Nature'. The overall inspiration for visuals and types of movement comes from the underwater world where weird creatures are inhabiting their space.</p>

<p>Ernst Haeckel was moved by wonders of the world, by intricate mathematical shapes he observed in nature, so he captured them in his illustrations. My aim in this project is to 'have a conversation' with him from the perspective of the 21st century that witnesses the abundance of technologies built on digits and the increasing knowledge of humankind to describe the world with mathematical formulas. That is why it is important for me to juxtapose Haeckel's illustrations with graphics: shapes and patterns that are generated digitally, with the use of code.</p>

<p>At the moment, the collection of gifs is in a developing stage and my plan is to evolve it into an installation with the help of 3d-mapping technologies.</p>
