<p>This series of paintings is a continuation of developing the plasticity and sculptural qualities of shapes that has already appeared in my work. Nevertheless, on this stage of my practice I am mostly inspired by human body, especially female, that is encompassing great potential for development, emergence and life, like shapes of vegetation that I used a lot before.</p>

<p>Inspired by women artists like Niki de Saint Phalle, Judy Chicago and Pipilotti Rist, I would like to celebrate female body and spirit not by depicting an eye-satisfying body-object but an abstraction that carries the sense of power, expansion, luminosity and emergence. This is the representation of empowered mind and body of female creatures in the technological fast-paced 21st century.</p>

<p>The technique is important as it encompasses the main idea. The pattern was created in vector software and manipulated to give an illusion of wrapped imaginative 3d shapes. The result was laser-cut to make stencils and the pattern was transferred to a painting surface using airbrush and acrylics. Later the paint was sprayed to create light and dark areas to get the maximum effect of flat surface being three-dimensional and full of light.</p>
